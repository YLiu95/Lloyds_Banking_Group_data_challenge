# Lloyds Banking Group data challenge

## Highlights:
• Created a comprehensive solution to tackle problems of missing data and imbalanced data.

• As a result, I boosted my deep learning models’ prediction accuracy and beat the benchmark model.

## Overview:

Lloyds Banking Group is launching a new loans product and needs to determine which customers they should lend to or not. They have approached you to design this process. To ensure they are lending responsibly, it is important that the process is easy to understand and fair/treats customers fairly.


### Step Up Challenge:

Lloyds Banking Group have sent you a dataset of customers who had a loan, the status of the product (default or not), as well as other credit and product information. Can you predict which customers will default on their loan and explain the key reasons why?
